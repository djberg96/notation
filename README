= Synopsis
  # Run with -Ku if using Ruby 1.8.
  require 'notation'
   
  λ { puts "hello" } # => "Hello"
  ∑ [1,2,3]          # => 6

  This library was inspired by the programming language Fortress, an offshoot
  of Fortran, created by Sun. Fortress supports unicode operators baked into
  the language.
