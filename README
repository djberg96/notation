= Description
  Unicode methods for Ruby.

= Installation
  gem install notation

= Synopsis
  # Run with -Ku if using Ruby 1.8.
  require 'notation'
   
  λ { puts "hello" } # => "Hello"
  ∑ [1,2,3]          # => 6
  √ 49               # => 7.0

= Author's Notes
  This library was inspired by the programming language Fortress, an offshoot
  of Fortran, created by Sun. Fortress supports unicode operators baked into
  the language.

= Restrictions
  The ability to add unicode methods is limited to method names that have
  no receiver. This is a limitation of the Ruby parser.
